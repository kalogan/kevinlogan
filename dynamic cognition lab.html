					<h3> The Lab's Goal </h3>
                    
                    <p>To conduct experiments designed to investigate the dynamic relationship between perception, action and cognition. </p>
                    
					<h3> Lab Experiments </h3>
					<p>
                  The lab was running two experiments when I was a member of it. The purpose of these two experiments was to see how flow affected our sense of time and control. We did this by making our participants play a computer video game. The participants controlled a house or train on the screen with a game controller. Their goal was to move the object back and forth across the screen until it eventually vanished. When it vanished they were to indicate either how in control they felt or how much time passed with each successful trial. After 20 successful trials, a questionnaire was given to assess how flow may have affected them. A questionnaire of their video game experience was given to them upon completion of the experiment.

                    </p>

                    
					<h3> My Contributions and Experience </h3>
                    <p>
                     Each week I spent several hours conducting research and moderating the labs. Our group went over statistical analysis of the experiments and explained how measurement scales give us a context for interpretation. Communication skills were worked on with each and every participant and while relaying observations to my group. Organizational skills were stressed while preparing the lab and making sure everything is up and ready. I am fortunate to have this experience working in a lab. Being able to work with others on this research team was also rewarding. I was able to learn how to cooperate with multiple coworkers and learn how to handle stress or problems that may arise.


					</p><p>
                    In addition, I learned about the theoretical side of our research. We discussed our experiments in our meetings. This helped me digest what was going on. We explored data sets with SPSS to understand the meaning of the experiments. In addition, we explored many papers on the topics of flow, spatial perception, embodied cognition, and consciousness. I already recognize how reading these papers are helping me in my current endeavors of user research and experience design.
