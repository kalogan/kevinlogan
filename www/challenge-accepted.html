          <h2 id="title">The Challenge</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">State Farm Insurance and Illinois State University hosted the Mobile Application Development (MAD) Contest. The challenge was to develop a working application for a mobile device of choice to promote good behavioral habits in students. I had to pitch my project once to gain acceptance into the finals and pitch it at the final presentations.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Solution</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">"Challenge Accepted" is an award winning social app. It was the winner of the 2014 State Farm Mobile Application Development Contest for the "Best Use of Technology" category. This app encourages users to challenge their friends to competitions promoting good habits in everyday life. 

          </p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">Users can compete in challenges from three categories: fitness, dieting, and daily living activities. Users take photos of them completing these challenges and send them to friends. Users can also read about interesting facts and play "Fact or Myth?" to test their knowledge.

          <h2 id="title">Design </h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">I decided to create a social app to help promote good behavioral habits in students. I researched the current marketplace to find similar apps. Different apps used various ways to reinforce positive habits, primarily through competition, achievements, and leaderboards. I decided to use competition as a primary motivation to keep people using app. The app was designed to help high school and college students become more knowledgeable and conscious of their everyday decisions.</p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">I designed it so users can compete in challenges from three categories: fitness, dieting, and daily living activities. The users take photos of them completing these challenges and send them to friends. A secondary concept I added was to educate the users. I did this by allowing users to read about interesting facts and play "Fact or Myth?" to test their knowledge.</p>

             I had to create a professional pitch presentation that demonstrated the potential of my app. The 10 minute presentation was judged off of different aspects of the app: originality, practicality, feasbility, quality of concept, quality of design, and most importantly- does it address a problem in a creative way.</p>

            I used a three tier architecture consisting of Android, Java Servlets, and SQLite.

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph">I used Android and LibGDX for the core devlelopment processes of the Android app. This connected with a Java Servlet backend to allow me to communicate to other users of this app. SQLite was the database of choice because it is a lighter, self-contained SQL database.

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph">The final presentation was presented in front of technology professionals at State Farm and professors at Illinois State University. This presentation was similar to the pitch presentation, but I had to present the fully working social app. I presented and it was all over! The judges were quite impressed with my use of the three tier architecture, especially since it was the first time I learned how to use them.

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">This was an amazing experience and definitely was rewarding. I hope to get involved in more competitions of this nature. I learned a lot from this experience, everything from: project management, time prioritization, networking with teachers, back-end, and mobile development. It was pretty cool to learn how to effectively build a three tier architecture. I now understand how typical applications communicate with web servers to retrieve data.       

             </p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">

              I ended up taking a web development technologies course which started in January. However, I had to teach myself ahead of the class for what I wanted to do. I had to teach myself how to properly make HTTP requests to a server(my computer), then access the database stored on my computer, and send a response back to my mobile device. It was pretty challenging to learn this on the fly. However, I had a few teachers that guided me in the right direction. So thanks especially to Mr. Mike Myers and Mr. Lee Assam!
