          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">Our team was asked to design a new museum exhibit that engaged participants to learn in a meaningful and interactive way. We chose to create a film to demonstrate the physical layout and interactions that took place inside of our exhibit.

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             Initially, our team wanted to create a museum exhibition about nutrition. Through our design process, we ultimately switched to body shaming. To start though, we all came up with several ideas and sketched them out. A few examples of these ideas were a museum where you are able to smell foods from different cultures, a 4d environment where visitors explored digestion of food, educational experience on foodborne illness, and a place to taste test food from different time periods and learn about them.</p>

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             Two weeks into the project, we had to present to our class the design concept, strategy, and plan of our project.  
           </p>

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
           The purpose of our exhibit is to call attention to our dietary habits as well as to educate museum-goers on how we select, consume and process food.
            What affects do our favorite foods have on us? What happens if we are deficient in one or more nutritional areas? How do we consume and then burn calories? How much do we really know about what we consume every day?
          </p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
          The exhibit will be built around the 24-hour cycle of food consumption, built into a circular space.
          The inner wall allows the patron to choose foods and enter various daily activities.
          The outer wall represents the effects these choices have on that individual.
          At the conclusion, the individual will receive a grade or some other designation related to his or her “healthy eating” habits.
           </p>

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
          Our next steps were to plan ahead. We wanted to conduct secondary research, on-site visits to large museums, interviews of museum-goers and nutritional experts. In addition, we wanted to create a prototype of our physical space, which was a circular area. Then we needed to work on our video, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production.
           </p>

              <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
          The feedback we received was generally positive, however one thing stung me. The class said our project was safe and didn't challenge anything. I took this to heart.

             I talked to the group and explained how we have a chance to take a risk, so why not do something else? I presented the idea of a body shaming based exhibit. Thankfully, our team was interested after a few conversations. I wanted our team to take a risk and work on a topic that is extremely controverisal and sensitive. I'm happy I did this.</p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             Our team came up with the concept of having a 4d environment that you can interact in. This would allow participants to become the person who is being shamed by other people. We are able to simulate these events to help people build empathy for others who go through this.</p>

             Four weeks into the project, we had to present to our class our story board and script for video pre-production.  
           </p>

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
           The new purpose of our exhibit is to call attention to body shaming. Here are some questions we want to answers:

            How can we help spread awareness of body shaming? How can we help others empathize for those engaging in body shaming?How can we help others love their bodies? How do we stop others from  inducing individuals into body shaming?

          </p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
          The exhibit will have two core interactive sections.
          First, there will be panels that participants can go up to and learn about body image issues.
           Second, there will be scenarios that participants can engage in. These scenarios will allow participants build empathy through experiencing first hand an issue a person has experienced in the past.
           </p>

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
          Let's walk through our storyboard. As you can see, participants go up to the panel to learn more about the exhibit and then wait in line. They enter a room where a scenario plays out, they are not sure what is happening yet. They go through two scenarios and notice people are being rude to them but they are not sure why. After finishing the scenarios, they walk into a room with a mirror in it. They look in the mirror and notice why people were being rude to them. They then listen to a person reflect about how it's happened to them in the past and tells them how awful it feels. The participants leaves the room with knowledge and empathy towards people who go through a certain body shaming issue.

              <p id="portfolio-paragraph">We had mixed feedback, such as the technical constraints required to pull this off and
how to ensure you are not hurting anyone’s feeling when they are going through this
exhibit. The technical constraints were easily handled because we found research of
products doing something similar to what we want to implement. The feedback on
people’s feelings was much harder to digest and solve. We decided to talk and discuss
the perceptions our class mates had. They felt like we were saying people with body 
image issues may take this as if “wow my life sucks.” From this, we want to flip and
encourage others to stop engaging in rude behavior for others. This hopefully allowed
the perception of discouraging bullying and accepting unique individuality.

           <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             All of the feedback we received prompted us to conduct more user research on the topic of body shaming. We conducted three rounds of research and employed techniques such as body-storming, role-playing, survey, interviews, and shadowing </p>
             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             First, we used a Human Centered Computing approach to find patterns of effective ways to raise peoples' awareness of body shaming. A secondary goal was to understand how individuals succumb to thoughts of body shaming. To do this, we shadowed participants who were viewing a nutrition awarness exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry. We also interviewed these people on their thoughts of this exhibit and their opinions of body image. </p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             Second, we used a Social Computing & Values approach to understand how society affect's an individual's body image. A secondary goal was to understand the different factors that contribute to body shaming. To do this, we role-played common scenarios people experience: a date at a restaurant, flirting, group of friends taking pictures, and working out at a gym. We also conducted a survey to record how people understand body image issues. </p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             Third, we used a Tangible & Affective Computing approach to understand how to actually build an interactive museum space. A secondary goal was to understand how to create scenarios that are realistic and help build empathy. To do this, we used body-storming and role-playing together to envision how an altercation on a bus may occur. </p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">
             We took many findings and insights from our research. Our team was able to understand how to build an interactive space that was believable and engaging for participants. In addition, we became better informed on the topic of body image which helped us approach this sensitive topic with more caution.</p>

              <h2 id="title">Experience Design</h2>
              <p id="portfolio-paragraph">Using our research, we really wanted to make sure the experience was fluid and easy to follow. That's why we decided to have participants come in and now use the panels to learn about individual people.
              </p>
              <p id="portfolio-paragraph">
               These participants would come to a panel and learn that normal people go through body shaming. They then have the opportunity to relive an experience in the individual's life. They sign up for it on this panel and can then go in line to wait. The can then enter the scenario room and hear the individual speak about their experience, and then allow the participant relive it.
               </p>
               <p id="portfolio-paragraph">
                The participants then have the ability to interact with the people or objects in the environment, or sit back and watch what happens. It's a 4d holographic environment, which allows for endless possibilities. This is because the people in the environment can carry a conversation with the participant and uses machine learning algorithms to learn how to appropriately interpret and react accordingly to the behavior of the participant.
