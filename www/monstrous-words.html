          <h2 id="title">The Challenge</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">We were challenged to create a compelling game in 42 hours (to promote diversity and inclusivity in education). The hack-a-thon was sponsored by Promoting Inclusivity in Technology Club (PIT), which is a student-led organization whose goal is to encourage community development within the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University.

          <h2 id="title">Our Solution</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">We created a runner style game called "Monstrous Words." The goal was to help educate and inform players about the harsh realities of micro inequities. The players run and dodge incoming monsters (monstrous words that people say). On death, a fact or qoute would be displayed to the user.

        </p>

            <p id="portfolio-paragraph">

            The game was developed using Java and the LibGDX game development framework.

          <h2 id="title">Project Plan </h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">At the start of the event (Friday at 6 pm), I examined our skill sets and created a plan. Our team included a developer and a UX/Visual designer. The developer had some prior experience working with Java, but none with LibGDX. He worked with me in a test/debug role which was extremely helpful. For design, since I'm a designer myself, I was able to be a laison between what was technically possible and what was feasible between design and development. This helped a lot with reducing scope creep, especially in this short of a timeframe.</p>

        <p><br></p>

        <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">

             At around noon on Saturday, we assembled at starting working on the game. I had found some tutorials online for some LibGDX engines I could create. I found a runner engine that I wanted to use, so both I and the other developer thoroughly read and built the tutorial. While we were doing this, I was instructing the designer on how to create the sprite sheets and other assets that would be required for the game.</p>

              <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">

            After completing the tutorial, I started reverse engineering the code to understand how to manipulate it. This was time consuming because I haven't worked with some of these classes and methods before. I was learning on the fly. At the same time, the other developer was instructed to ensure cross compatibility of code throughout web and desktop. The designer and I bounced off ideas for what screens and menus we wanted to create.</p>

              <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">

             In the end, we built a fully functional prototype of a game! We only spent around 21 hours or so on design and development. Next time we do this, I need to make sure I have more time to work within the time!</p>

          <h2 id="title">Usability Testing</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">In the waning hours of the night, I conducted a remote usability test with my friend Anton. I wanted to ensure this game was usable, while gauging how fun the game was to play. I was able to consider some design ideas from the usability testing. 

          </p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">The participant enjoyed the game and thought the visual style and layout was easy to use. However, he was not a fan of the control system. I was unable to make any tweaks to the code at this point due to the looming deadline (it was 7 am and I didn't sleep in over 24 hours at this point).

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph">To sum it all up, what I have to say is WOW - we created a prototype in this short of time.  Here are some of the things I learned while working on this.        

             </p>

             <p id="portfolio-paragraph">

              1.) Leadership Skills, gained quality experience leading a sprint <br>

              2.) Planning every aspect is paramount to your success in sprints<br>

              3.) Focusing on one platform is smarter<br>

              4.) Design an experience that meets the needs of your audience<br>

              5.) I'm disappointed I haven't participated in more hack-a-thons!<br>

              6.) I miss game development, it's a true passion of mine <br>
