          <h2 id="title">The Challenge</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">I was asked to create a new design for a website that students used. This was a SharePoint website that allowed students to submit administrative forms and keep track of their scholarship requirements. 

          </p>



          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">There were to be three main work flows: a page that allowed students to track their progress in the program, a form that allowed students to submit an event excuse, and a form that allowed them to submit a leave notification to staff.

          <p><br></p>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph" class="text-left">I created a new design for how the students would access SharePoint. This website allows students to keep track of their progress in the scholarship program and submit forms in case they could not attend an event or need to leave the scholarship program for various reasons.

        <h2 id="title">Research </h2>

        <p id="portfolio-paragraph">I started off by communicating with the previous project owner to see where she started. Then I communicated with my boss and the web developers who would be working it. On top of this, I examined the existing SharePoint site and how the interactions were on the page.

        </p>

        <p id="portfolio-paragraph">

          By interviewing various staff members and conducting a heuristic evaluation on the page, I uncovered some issues. 

        </p>

        <p id="portfolio-paragraph">

          The primary issues were the actual interactions on each of the main pages: Lead Requirements, Event Excuse, and Leave Notification. Each of these pages were confusing to use because there were unnecessary steps and redundant data entry. I made sure to fix these two problems.

           I wanted to keep the look and feel consistent with this web site and the new HHSP website that I created previously in the semester. To start, I sketched my ideas out and had four iterations.

          <h2 id="title">Usability Testing</h2>

          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">I conducted three separate usabilty tests. The first test was with three participants and included two students of the SharePoint site. From this test I found out that some of the navigation semantics and options to fill out on the forms were confusing. I fixed this and redrew the sketches.

          </p>
          <p id="portfolio-paragraph">

           I tested again on three new participants, with two being students. Students still were not clear about the titles for some of the top navigation links. It was challenging to figure out what vocabulary freshman students would be able to understand. Conducting card sorts helped me figure this out. I then made high-fidelity mock-ups and tested on two more students.

      <p id="portfolio-paragraph">It was great to obtain experience practicing what I was learning in class. I made sure to go through the entire design process when working on this. I tried my best to preach the value of using a user-centered design approach to projects. My boss and co-workers understood the importance of designing with the user in mind, specically conducting research and usability tests on people who actually use this site.
